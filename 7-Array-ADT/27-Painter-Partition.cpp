// Problem Statement (CodeStudio)

// Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and 
// each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters 
// are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.
// You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards 
// under a constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

// Sample Input
// 2
// 4 2
// 5 5 5 5
// 4 2
// 10 20 30 40

// Sample Output
// 10
// 60

// Explanation
// In the first test case, we can divide the boards into 2 equal-sized partitions, 
// so each painter gets 10 units of the board and the total time taken is 10.
