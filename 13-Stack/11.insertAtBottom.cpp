// Insert An Element At Its Bottom In A Given Stack 

/*
You are given a stack/deque of integers 'MY-STACK' and an integer ‘X’. Your task is to insert ‘X’ to the bottom of ‘MY-STACK’ and return the updated stack/deque.
Note :
If ‘MY_STACK’ = [7, 1, 4, 5], then the first element represents the element at the bottom of the stack and the last element represents the element at the top of the stack.

Input Format :
The first line of input contains a single integer T’, representing the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two single space-separated numbers, ‘N’ and ‘X’, denoting the size of ‘MY_STACK’ and the integer to be inserted at the bottom, respectively.

The second line contains ‘N’ space-separated distinct integers denoting the stack/deque elements.

Output Format :
For each test case, print the elements of the updated ‘MY_STACK’ separated by a single space.

The output of every test case will be printed in a separate line.
