Problem Statement

Left View of Binary Tree - GFG

Given a Binary Tree, print Left view of it. Left view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is visited from Left side. The task is to complete the function leftView(), which accepts root of the tree as argument.

Left view of following tree is 1 2 4 8.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /     \    /    \
  4     5   6    7
   \
     8   

Example 1:

Input:
   1
 /  \
3    2
Output: 1 3

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
0 <= Number of nodes <= 100
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000
