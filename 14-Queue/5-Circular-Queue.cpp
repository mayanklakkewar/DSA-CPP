Circular Queue (CodeStudio)

Problem Statement:

You will be given ‘Q’ queries. You need to implement a circular queue according to those queries. Each query will belong to one of these two types:

1 ‘X’: Enqueue element ‘X’ into the end of the nth queue. Returns true if the element is enqueued, otherwise false.

2: Dequeue the element at the front of the nth queue. Returns -1 if the queue is empty, otherwise, returns the dequeued element.

Note:
Enqueue means adding an element to the end of the queue, while Dequeue means removing the element from the front of the queue.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers ‘N’ and ‘Q’ denoting the size of queue and number of queries, respectively. 

The next ‘Q’ lines specify the type of operation/query to be performed on the data structure.

Each query contains an integer ‘P’ denoting the type of query.

For query of type 1, the integer ‘P’ is equal to 1 and it is followed by one integer ‘X’ denoting the element on which operation is to be performed.

For query of type 2, the integer ‘P’ is equal to 2 which dequeues the element.

Output Format:
For each query, return the output returned after performing the corresponding operation on the data structure. 

Print the output of each test case in a separate line.

Note:
You don’t need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. You just have to complete the given functions.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Q <= 10^5 
1 <= P <= 2
1 <= X <= 10^5

Time limit: 1 sec
